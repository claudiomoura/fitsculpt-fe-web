# Exercise dataset provenance and license note

## Source used in this PR
- Seed source file: `apps/api/prisma/data/exercises.json`.
- Provenance: this JSON file is the current FitSculpt curated exercise catalog extracted from the pre-existing local seed list (same records/fields), moved to a standalone dataset file so seed import is file-based and maintainable.

## License / commercial-use verification
- This dataset content is first-party project data already present in this repository history.
- No third-party external dataset has been imported in this PR.
- Commercial use: allowed under the same rights as the FitSculpt repository content.

## External dataset status (`wrkout/exercises.json`)
- Requested external source could not be verified from this environment due outbound access restrictions.
- Per project safety rules, an unverified third-party dataset was not committed.
- If/when an external source is approved, update this note with:
  - exact URL/revision,
  - explicit license name,
  - commercial-use clause confirmation.
